# StatisticalEngine
A Statistics Platform. 
The goal of this project is to create a system that can recieve data from an external source, compare the data to historical data, and determine if that data belongs to the historical population or not. The system also is capable of updating the historic mean (and standard deviation in case of z-tests) when incoming sample data is determined to belong to the historic population.
